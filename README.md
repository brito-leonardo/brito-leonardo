### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a brazilian theoretical physicist. I have been working with Atomic and Molecular Physics for about 8 years, mostly performing computational simulations and analytical approaches to solve nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger and Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Here, I have provided some codes in Fortran 90 and Python 3 to handle numerical approximations to solve Ordinary and Partial Differential equations, which are very important for physics problems. Recently, I have been very interested in Data Science and Machine Learning and I have attended some on-line courses on coursera, so eventually I am uploading some material about it here.

Thank you for the visit!
